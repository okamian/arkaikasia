# ❄️ Ice Arena 3v3

## About the 3v3 Tournament

* Our tournament aims to bring fun with a PvP mechanic different from the usual, which is usually more intense with little strategy.
* With our mechanics of damage reduction, cooldown on skill and potion heals, and central buffs with 100% HP/SP heal, PvP becomes less “all in” and more about positioning and strategy.

## **Arena Opening Hours**

The Arena will be open in friendly mode **(no scoring)** every day from <mark style="color:red;">**8:00 AM to 9:59 AM**</mark>, from <mark style="color:red;">**3:00 PM to 4:59 PM**</mark>, and from <mark style="color:red;">**7:00 PM to 8:59 PM**</mark>.

## Mechanics

* **Teams are random**, which makes it fairer and prevents "cliques".
* <mark style="color:red;">**Damage reduced by 65%**</mark>**.**
* <mark style="color:green;">**Healing skills**</mark> get <mark style="color:red;">**+10 seconds cooldown**</mark>.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Consumables**</mark> get <mark style="color:red;">**+15 seconds cooldown**</mark>.
* **Winning** a match gives <mark style="color:green;">**20 points**</mark>, and **losing** will take <mark style="color:red;">**15 points**</mark>.
* It’s not allowed to leave the map or teleport out. If you log out during a match, **60 points will be removed** as punishment.
* Every **30 seconds**, a **random set of buffs** is **spawned** in the center of the map, granting various buffs and **healing 100% HP and SP** of everyone in the group that captures it.
* There are **3 buff sets**, and every **30 seconds** one of the sets will **spawn**, each with its own animation and visual effect for identification.

## Life System

* Each team has 3 members.
* Each player has <mark style="color:red;">**3 lives**</mark>.
* When all members of a team lose their 3 lives, the match ends.
* The team that still has at least 1 member with 1 life wins.

## **NOTES**

* Entering the enemy base (crossing the bridge) results in instant death—your character dies immediately. This is to provide a safe zone for parties to regroup.
* At 3 minutes into the match, the safe zone is disabled to prevent parties from avoiding combat.
* At 4 minutes into the match, an Emperium will spawn in the center of the map. The group that destroys it will automatically cause one member of the enemy group to lose a life. The Emperium will then respawn every 1 minute thereafter.
* <mark style="color:red;">**Emperium has REDUCED HP, has no immunities, and does not suffer element reduction.**</mark>
