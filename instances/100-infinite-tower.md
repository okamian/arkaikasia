## **Tower Mechanics**

**2. Tower Structure**

* The tower consists of <mark style="color:red;">**100 floors**</mark>, each more challenging than the previous one.
* <mark style="color:red;">**After completing all 100 floors, it will RESET**</mark> back to **level 1** automatically. However, all **monsters will become stronger, with increased HP and higher LOOT rates**.
* **Regular floors:**
  * You will face waves of common monsters.
* **Checkpoint floors (every 5-10 floors):**
  * **MVPs** or mini-bosses will spawn as the main challenge.
  * **Examples:** Eddga, Stormy Knight, Dracula, Valkyrie Randgris, among others.

***

**3. Basic Rules**

* **Time limit:** The instance lasts **4 hours** from the moment it is created.
* **Shared progress:** If someone dies, they can return to the tower **as long as the party leader remains inside**.
* **Group challenges:** Only **one party** can enter the instance at a time.
* **Monster respawn:** Monsters spawn **in waves or batches**, depending on the floor.
* **Rewards:** You receive **rewards for defeating MVPs**.
