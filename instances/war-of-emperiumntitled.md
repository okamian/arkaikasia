## **About Divine Items**

* <mark style="color:red;">**Divine items (Godlys)**</mark> can be crafted <mark style="color:red;">**by the guild leader**</mark> inside the Guild Hall, using **g**<mark style="color:red;">**uild points**</mark>. These points are earned through donations and as <mark style="color:red;">**WoE rewards**</mark>.
* All members can buy guild points using <mark style="color:red;">**Zeny**</mark>, with a <mark style="color:red;">**limit of 1,000 weekly points per guild**</mark> (not per player). This allows PvE-focused guilds to also craft Godlys, although it may take more time.\


## **Divine Item Creation**

<mark style="color:red;">**About divine items**</mark>

* Castle treasures will be available for purchase from the **WoE Representative NPC** in the **Guild Hall** (only the guild master can purchase).
* A new category of special items (**Castle Jewels**) will be added to the **WoE Representative** in the **Guild Hall** and will be used to create items of the same rarity as castle treasures (only the guild master can use this feature).
* Each castle treasure will cost 1,500 Guild Points.
*   Divine items are divided into 2 categories (**Normal** and **Eternal**). Besides attribute differences, crafting an **eternal** divine item will **require the normal version** of that item in addition to other requirements.\
