You cannot change direction while running. You can stop using the Running skill again (without SP cost to stop), using another skill, or running into a wall. When you use this skill (at least at level 7) and stop immediately, you will gain a <strong>+10 STR</strong> bonus and an additional <strong>+{SkillLevel*10}%</strong> damage boost for the Flying Kick skill for <strong>150 seconds</strong> if unarmed (works for TK and SG, not for SL). If you have no weapon equipped, your kicking skill damage will increase by <strong>+10 per level</strong>, up to a maximum of <strong>+100</strong>.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/412a.png" alt=""></td><td>Tornado Stance</td><td>This is a skill that you can toggle on and off by pressing the skill button.

When active, there is a <strong>15%</strong> chance of entering stance to use the <strong>Sweeping Kick</strong> skill.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/417a.png" alt=""></td><td>Sweeping Kick</td><td>You can only use this skill while in <strong>Sweeping Kick Stance</strong>.

Normally, you would have to select this skill manually to attack, but if you use it while <strong>Somersaulting</strong>, you will attack the dodged target automatically. The damage is <strong>{SkillLevel*10+30}%</strong>, but if used immediately after <strong>Somersault</strong>, it becomes stronger as your base level increases.

(Ranking resets when the server restarts.)</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/827a.png" alt=""></td><td>Combo F</td><td>Perform <strong>5 consecutive attacks</strong> on the same target to activate this skill and enter <strong>Combo 1</strong>, initiating <strong>Combo State</strong>.

Basic attacks have a <strong>3%</strong> chance to deal <strong>{SkillLevel}%</strong> of the target's current HP as damage (does not work on epic monsters).
