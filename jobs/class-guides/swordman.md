The regeneration rate increases according to the user's life. Also improves the healing effectiveness of HP recovery items by (10*SkillLevel)%. The effect is canceled if the user cannot naturally regenerate HP, for example, due to exceeding the weight limit. The regeneration time is reduced by 5 seconds when sitting.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/5a.png" alt=""></td><td>Fatal Strike</td><td>Strikes the opponent with a single physical melee attack, dealing (100+30<em>SkillLevel)% ATK damage. Increasing the skill level improves the chances of hitting the target. The success rate is (5SkillLevel)%.</em> The skill is influenced by the character's attack animation. Increasing attack speed makes skill usage faster.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/6a.png" alt=""></td><td>Taunt</td><td>Attempts to provoke the target to attract them. If successful, it reduces the target's DEF by (10-5<em>SkillLevel)% and **increases their ATK by (2+3</em>SkillLevel).** Passive monsters will become aggressive towards the user. The success rate is currently (50+3*SkillLevel)%. Against other players, it reduces their DEF attributes. Interrupts spell casting. Does not work on undead and MVPs. Frees allies from confusion.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/7a.png" alt=""></td><td>Explosive Impact</td><td>Creates a massive explosion, dealing melee physical damage equal to (100+20<em>SkillLevel)% ATK and <strong>pushing enemies around the character back two cells.</strong> Accuracy of this skill is (10</em>SkillLevel)%. In the next 10 seconds, the user cannot dodge and will take (10*SkillLevel)% increased damage.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/8a.png" alt=""></td><td>Vigor</td><td>Increases magic defense by (1*SkillLevel). Prevents your character from being unable to perform actions when receiving attacks. The effect duration is interrupted if the user receives 7 hits.
