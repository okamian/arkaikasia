### **.NET 8 Installation**

Many **Arkaik: Tales of Sarina** players report that, during the update process, a message appears requesting the installation of **.NET 8** (either **x86** or **x64** version). While this is a simple process, some players may be confused or think it's an error.

**What is .NET 8?**

.NET 8 is a collection of **libraries and tools** required to run certain Windows applications, including games. If your system does not have the correct version of .NET 8 installed, the **game or launcher may not work properly**.

**Why Does This Happen?**

During some updates, the game may require **specific functionalities** from **.NET 8**. If your system does not have the necessary version installed, the launcher will automatically request the framework installation.

**What Should You Do When This Message Appears?**

(Next steps would likely include downloading and installing .NET 8â€”if needed, let me know!)

1. Click the link provided in the message or visit the official Microsoft website to download **DIRECT LINK** or **.NET8 LINK**.
2. Download and install it **directly on your computer** (**IMPORTANT**).
3. Run the **Arkaik: Tales of Sarina** launcher again and check if the issue is resolved.

#### **Common Problem Solutions**

If installing **.NET Framework** does not resolve the problem or you still see the message:

1. Make sure you have installed **.NET 8**.
2. Try updating **Windows** to ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
3. Check if your **antivirus or firewall** is blocking the game's installation or execution after the update.
